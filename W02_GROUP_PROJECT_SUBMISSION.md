# W02 Group Project Submission

## 1. Meeting Summary & Participants

Our group met on [DATE] via [Zoom/Discord/in-person]. We began with a prayer and discussed the project requirements, scope, and goals. We reviewed the assignment instructions, clarified the projectâ€™s purpose, and brainstormed initial user stories and work items. We also discussed our preferred color scheme, typography, and layout ideas. The group leader created the GitHub repository and invited all members as collaborators. Each member cloned the repository to their local machine. We concluded by assigning initial tasks and selecting a new group leader for the next meeting.
